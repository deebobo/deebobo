A common use case is for storing data produced by devices, into a table that is capable of storing historical data. The plugin requires a reference to 2 connections: the 'from' connection serves as the source of the data while the 'to' connection is the destination.  Some source connections require some extra information (for instance to register a webhook). This can be provided in the 'extra' field which expects valid json data. As an example, the particle.io connection requires a list of fields for which is should create webhooks. This is defined with the following json struct:{'fields' : ['G']} ",
