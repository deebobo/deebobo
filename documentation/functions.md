# Functions
A function is a server side task that can run continuously in the background or that can be triggered with an api call. Typical usage for functions are:
- push data from 1 connection to another
- calculate metrics and store them in a connection
- ...

Functions are implemented as plugins. Usually, they come with a client side configuration section and a backend that performs the actual task.
